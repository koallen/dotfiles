# My dotfiles

This repo contains some of my dotfiles.

## Installation

Clone the directory in `$HOME` and run my `install.sh` script.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:koallen/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

You can either run the script directly or provide the apps that
you want to install dotfiles for.

```bash
# install for all apps
$ ./install.sh

# install for certain apps
$ ./install.sh neovim zsh
```
